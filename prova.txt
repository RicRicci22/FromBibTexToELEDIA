abstract={The problem of imaging two-dimensional “non-sparse” scatterers with piecewise-constant contrast is solved through an innovative total-variation compressive sensing (TV-CS) technique. Under Born approximation (BA), the time-harmonic two-dimensional inverse scattering problem is reformulated into an equivalent Augmented Lagrangian one according to the TV-CS formulation. The resulting unconstrained functional is then minimized by means of a deterministic alternating direction algorithm. Selected results from a numerical assessment are discussed to give the interested reader some insights on the accuracy, the flexibility, the robustness, and the efficiency of the TV-CS inversion scheme also in comparison with available implementations of state-of-the-art inversion methods still formulated within the BA.},

abstract={The use of inhomogeneous metamaterial lenses is proposed to enable suitable radiation properties for arbitrary-shape antenna arrays. Towards this end, the Quasi-Conformal Transformation Optics (QCTO) methodology is generalized to allow an arbitrary physical arrangement coated with a suitable lens to exhibit the same radiating features of an arbitrary reference virtual array in free space. A representative numerical example, concerned with a two-dimensional layout, is presented to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method as well as the enhanced features of the resulting metamaterial-coated arrays with respect to standard conformal arrangements.},

abstract={Sparsening conformal arrangements is carried out through a versatile Multi-Task Bayesian Compressive Sensing (MT-BCS) strategy. The problem, formulated in a probabilistic fashion as a pattern-matching synthesis, is that of determining the sparsest excitation set (locations and weights) fitting a reference pattern subject to user-defined geometrical constraints. Results from a set of representative numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the key-features of the proposed approach as well as to assess, also through comparisons, its potentials in terms of matching accuracy, element saving, and computational costs.},
