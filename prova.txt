abstract={The problem of imaging nonweak scatterers in the compressive sensing (CS) framework, without recurring to the contrast-source formulation, is addressed by means of an innovative hybrid born iterative CS method (BI-CSM). Toward this end, the born iterative (BI) formulation of the nonlinear inverse scattering equations is adopted and a customized version of the CS-based inversion is implemented to retrieve the target contrast while estimating the electric field distribution without recurring to time-expensive full-wave simulations. The selected numerical and experimental results, drawn from a wide validation, are presented to illustrate the procedural steps of the BI-CSM and to assess, also comparatively, the features, the potentialities, and the limitations of the proposed inversion technique.},

abstract={The problem of imaging arbitrary-shaped targets is addressed through a methodological generalization of the compressive sensing (CS) paradigm. The Color CS (C-CS) methodology consists of a two-level hierarchical scheme where, at the first level and using a basis dictionary, several sparsity-regularized inversions are performed in parallel, while, at the second level, the retrieved expansion coefficients are compared to select the most reliable reconstruction according to a sparsity-rewarding criterion. Within the Born-approximated formulation of the microwave imaging problem, a Bayesian solver and a filtered $\ell _{0}$ -norm criterion are employed to implement the first and the second C-CS levels, respectively. Selected numerical results, representative of an extensive validation, are presented to illustrate the features, the advantages, and the limitations of C-CS also in comparison with some competitive state-of-the-art inversion techniques.},

abstract={A new methodology that exploits the matrix completion (MC) paradigm is proposed to image weak and sparse scatterers in heavy noise conditions. The 2-D inverse problem, mathematically formulated under the first-order Born approximation, is addressed with a three-phase algorithm that consists of: 1) an initial estimation step where a preliminary reconstruction of the distribution of the contrast and the associated “confidence map” are computed by means of a Bayesian compressive sensing method; 2) a filtering step devoted to identify and discard the less reliable contrast coefficients; and 3) a final dielectric profile completion step aimed at recovering a faithful image of the whole scattering scenario by exploiting a customized MC procedure. Representative numerical results and comparisons with competitive state-of-the-art inversion techniques are reported and discussed to assess the accuracy, the robustness, and the numerical efficiency of the proposed approach.},
