abstract={The tapered wave with the tapering parameter g has been applied to numerical simulation of electromagnetic scattering from randomly rough surface with illuminated finite surface length L. This communication presents how to select the parameters g and L, and shows quantitative relationship with the incident angle. The parameter g, as a function of incident angle, should be large enough to make the wave equation in the range of allowable error. The surface length L, larger than several correlation lengths, should be large enough to suppress the punctuated power at the surface edges and be limited to make efficient computation. Combining these criterions, a graphical format to locate g and L for different incident angle /spl theta//sub i/ is illustrated. An empirical formula for selecting g and L as a function of /spl theta//sub i/ is proposed.},

abstract={In this article, an automatic and forward method is realized to establish attributed scattering center models directly from the computer-aided design (CAD) model of the complex target. The main steps include the preprocessing of the CAD model, the separation of scattering sources, the selection of strong scattering sources, and the automatic determination of model parameters. With the proposed method, the scattering sources, scattering mechanisms, and model parameters of the scattering centers can be identified and derived, such that the complicated manual intervention is completely avoided. Moreover, the method establishes the distributed scattering center models formed by curved surfaces with large curvature radii. Therefore, the formation mechanism of the distributed scattering center is extended from typical scattering structures to a general case. Thus, the model of the attributed scattering center is extended and can be applied to describe the scattering from the real structures of the complex target. The geometric shape of the scattering source is distinguished based on the principal curvature radii, which are calculated by differential geometry theory. Thus, the frequency dependence parameter is obtained according to its corresponding relationship with the geometric shape. In addition, based on the automatic method, a technology is studied to diagnose and correct the scattering center models of a target whose CAD model is unknown or partially known. Finally, parametric models of several targets in the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition Recognition (MSTAR) program are established, and then compared with the measured data. The results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={The Foldy-Lax equation is used to derive a multiple scattering model for the multiple-scattering small anisotropic spheres. By this model, if the number of the non-zero singular values of the multistatic response (MSR) matrix is smaller than the number of the antennas, the range space of the MSR matrix is found to be spanned by the background Green's function vectors corresponding to the and components of the electric and magnetic dipoles induced in each scatterer, which indicates that the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) method could be implemented to obtain the locations of the scatterers. After estimating the positions of the scatterers, a non-iterative analytical method is proposed for retrieving the polarization strength tensors as well as the orientations of the principle axes of each scatterer. Two numerical simulations show that, the MUSIC method and the non-iterative method are efficacious for the nonlinear inverse scattering problem of determining the locations and polarization strength tensors of multiple-scattering small anisotropic spheres. Such methods could also be applied to the inversion of small isotropic spheres or extended to the inversion of small bianisotropic spheres.},

abstract={For Pt.I see ibid., vol.47, no.7, p.1208-17 (July 1999). This paper is concerned with the reconstruction of a weakly inhomogeneous scattering profile from data generated by a short-pulse incident plane wave, which is postprocessed so as to localize the interrogated region to a space-time resolved scattering cell, The phase-space localization due to postprocessing is brought about by applying local (i.e., windowed) slant-stack transforms to the time-dependent scattered fields. In the domain of the scatterer, this processing corresponds to applying windowed Radon transforms to the induced field distribution, which, in turn, generates pulsed-beam (PB) wave packets traveling toward the observer. The forward analysis parameterizing this new form of time-domain (TD) diffraction tomography has been performed in a companion paper and furnishes the framework for the investigation here. Via the forward parameterization, the three-dimensional (3-D) global scattering phenomenology has been reduced to scattering from an equivalent one-dimensional (1-D) scattering cell oriented along the bisector between the direction of the incident plane pulse and the direction of the scattered pulsed beam (PB) to the observer. For the inverse problem, this process is reversed by windowing the scattered field and backpropagating the resulting PBs so as to form local images of any selected region in the scattering domain. The phase-space signature of the scattering cell is related to the Radon transform of the medium in the cell so that the local profile function can be recovered by Radon inversion. An illustrative numerical example is included. Also discussed is the ultimate localization achieved by incident PB excitation and PB postprocessing of the scattered field.},

abstract={Based on the orthogonalities among the spherical vector wave functions, the expressions of scattering fields are developed as the particle being irradiated by the zeroth-order field and the first-order fields of x, y, and z. A general relation between the expansion coefficients of scattering field and incident field is presented. With the example of the elliptical beam, the scattering property of a particle in beam is investigated. Upon analyzing of the effects of the beam waist, irradiating distance, etc., on scattering property, the validity of the algorithm used is demonstrated. The results show that the beam waist may improve the particle's identification property and the particle has a strong scattering property in both forward and backward directions. The method used is simple and provides a new way for investigating the scattering fields from particles in electromagnetic beams.},

abstract={A multiple-component scattering model (MCSM) is proposed to decompose polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images. The MCSM extends a three-component scattering model, which describes single-bounce, double-bounce, volume, helix, and wire scattering as elementary scattering mechanisms in the analysis of PolSAR images. It can be found that double-bounce, helix, and wire scattering are predominant in urban areas. These elementary scattering mechanisms correspond to the asymmetric reflection condition that the copolar and cross-polar correlations are not close to zero. The MCSM is demonstrated with a German Aerospace Center (DLR) Experimental Synthetic Aperture Radar (ESAR) L-band full-polarized image of the Oberpfaffenhofen Test Site Area (DE), Germany, which was obtained on September 30, 2000. The result of this decomposition confirmed that the proposed model is effective for analysis of buildings in urban areas.},

abstract={Photorealistic visualization of a huge number of individual filaments like in the case of hair, fur, or knitwear is a challenging task: Explicit rendering approaches for simulating radiance transfer at a filament get totally impracticable with respect to rendering performance and it is also not obvious how to derive efficient scattering functions for different levels of (geometric) abstraction or how to deal with very complex scattering mechanisms. We present a novel uniform formalism for light scattering from filaments in terms of radiance, which we call the bidirectional fiber scattering distribution function (BFSDF). We show that previous specialized approaches, which have been developed in the context of hair rendering, can be seen as instances of the BFSDF. Similar to the role of the BSSRDF for surface scattering functions, the BFSDF can be seen as a general approach for light scattering from filaments, which is suitable for deriving approximations in a canonic and systematic way. For the frequent cases of distant light sources and observers, we deduce an efficient far field approximation (bidirectional curve scattering distribution function, BCSDF). We show that on the basis of the BFSDF, parameters for common rendering techniques can be estimated in a non-ad-hoc, but physically-based way},

abstract={In the three- or four-component decompositions, polarimetric scattering properties and corresponding physical scattering models play essential roles for power decomposition. This letter proposes an improved four-component scattering power decomposition method that employs a suitable volume scattering model for single- or double-bounce scattering in the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar image analysis. The cross-polarized HV component is created by both single-bounce object (such as vegetation) and double-bounce structures (such as oriented building blocks). It has been difficult to discriminate these two objects (vegetation against oriented buildings) in the decomposed images since the HV component is assigned to the volume scattering due to vegetation only. We propose to extend the volume scattering model suited for two physical scattering models. It is shown that a vegetation area and an oriented urban building area are well discriminated compared to those resulting from the implementation of the existing four-component scattering power decomposition.},
