abstract={In this paper a class of recently introduced Bayesian approaches for the solution of directions-of-arrival (DoAs) estimation problems is illustrated and discussed. More in detail, the problem of the estimation of the DoAs of electromagnetic narrow-band signals impinging on an antenna array is addressed in this paper by means of a strategy based on the Bayesian Compressive Sensing (BCS). Firstly, the relation between the data (i.e. the measured voltages) and the unknown DoAs is formulated as a linear relationship with sparse solution. Successively, the problem is solved by applying the BCS in order to estimate the most probable sparse solution fitting the measured input data. Preliminary numerical examples aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the considered techniques are presented.},

abstract={In this work the problem of synthesizing the excitations of a linear array, clustered into contiguous sub-arrays of irregular length, is addressed. By suitably exploiting the behavior of clustered array aperture distributions (i.e., step-wise discrete functions), the problem has been formulated as the minimization of the total variation (TV) of the excitations, satisfying a matching condition on a predefined reference pattern. In virtue of the sparse nature of the unknowns, the minimization problem has been solved by means of an efficient total variation compressive sensing (TV-CS) optimization approach. A simple example validating the proposed technique is finally reported.},

abstract={Innovative inversion methodologies exploiting the paradigm of Bayesian Compressive Sensing (BCS) have been successfully introduced in the last few years to address sparse and linear microwave imaging problems. Their success is motivated by several concurring factors, including their capability to estimate the “confidence level” of the obtained inversions. Despite the informative content associated to such estimations, confidence maps have been mostly used to assess the quality of microwave images rather than to enhance it. The possibility to integrate rank-minimization techniques with BCS imaging strategies, recently introduced in the framework of Matrix Completion Inversion, will be reviewed in this work. Selected numerical examples considering a Born formulation of the tomographic microwave imaging problem will be presented to illustrate the features and capabilities of the arising techniques.},

abstract={A new methodology that exploits the matrix completion (MC) paradigm is proposed to image weak and sparse scatterers in heavy noise conditions. The 2-D inverse problem, mathematically formulated under the first-order Born approximation, is addressed with a three-phase algorithm that consists of: 1) an initial estimation step where a preliminary reconstruction of the distribution of the contrast and the associated “confidence map” are computed by means of a Bayesian compressive sensing method; 2) a filtering step devoted to identify and discard the less reliable contrast coefficients; and 3) a final dielectric profile completion step aimed at recovering a faithful image of the whole scattering scenario by exploiting a customized MC procedure. Representative numerical results and comparisons with competitive state-of-the-art inversion techniques are reported and discussed to assess the accuracy, the robustness, and the numerical efficiency of the proposed approach.},

abstract={Sparseness-promoting inversion strategies based on Bayesian formulations have recently emerged as powerful, robust, flexible, and accurate techniques to address a wide variety of problems arising in microwave imaging. The success of such paradigm is motivated by the capability of the resulting formulations to (i) handle sparse linear/linearized problems even when incoherence or restricted isometry properties (RIPs) are not guaranteed, and to (ii) provide self-computed “confidence level” estimations. Unfortunately, no methodology has been proposed in the state-of-the-art to actually exploit such confidence-level indexes and enhance the reconstructed profiles once the imaging reliability is self-detected to be poor (e.g., in harsh signal-to-noise-ratio scenarios, or when the RIP does not hold true). Moreover, the most popular BCS formulations handle the unknowns as 1D vectors, therefore neglecting the “matrix” nature of the associated physical problem (e.g., contrast retrieval). In this framework, this paper is aimed at illustrating the possibility to exploit a new class of methodologies based on rank-minimization formulations to overcome the above limitations and recover reliable reconstructions of the scattering scenario by fully exploiting the 2D matrix nature of the problem. Selected preliminary numerical results will be also discussed to validate the proposed paradigm.},
