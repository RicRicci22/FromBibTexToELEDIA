abstract={The distorted Rytov iterative method (DRIM) is proposed for the reconstruction of the unknown dielectric objects embedded in two-dimensional (2-D) homogeneous space. The DRIM is based on the distorted-wave Rytov approximation and is solved iteratively by incrementally correcting the estimated contrast function in each iteration step. The background medium Green's function is calculated numerically and is updated in each iteration step. Experimental and numerical results are presented to validate the proposed method for 2-D permittivity distribution reconstruction for both lossless and lossy cases.},
